A note on grades: Each section below lists elements of the project that were evaluated according to the following scale: 3-above and beyond or exception, 2-complete and on-par with expectations, 1-missing or area for improvement. Grades are evaluated by successful completion in HTML, CSS, Javascript and overall technique.

*Identifying elements: Demonstrates comprehension of the difference between classes for identifying a type of element, and IDs for identifying a specific unique element on the page  
*HTML: 
!DOCTYPE html, body, head, meta, div, a, ul, header, footer, nav

*Clean and Readable Code: 
Demonstrates ability to maintain clean and readable code including: consistent indentation, code commenting (e.g. when closing tags, demarcating sections of code, describing possibly ambiguous code choices)  
*Search Engine Optimization (SEO): 
Understands SEO best-practices related to HTML markup, and content optimization 
*Separation of Concerns: 
Understands HTML is primarily used for the organization and structure of web page content, while CSS is used for presentation style. Understands best practices such as including CSS in a separate file.
*HTML Structure: Are the pages broken down into logical sections? 
*HTML Tags: Rate the quality of the student’s choice of HTML tags. How often did the student choose the best (most semantic) element for the job? Are nested tags correctly nested (does the nesting make sense? Can a div> be a direct descendent of a ul>)? 


##CSS Basics:## 
*Background, color, font-family, font-size, text decoration, line-height, a:hover, border, padding, margin 
*CSS Structure: 
Is the code separated into logical sections? 
*CSS3 Techniques: 
At least two of the following properties introduced in CSS3 along with the proper vendor prefixes: border-radius, text-shadow, box-shadow, opacity, RGBA 
*Centered #container div: 
*Grid based design: «Grid_based_design»
*Navigation: 
*Presence of Form Fields and : 

Code organization: 
Are procedural code and event handlers separated from functions? 
Program Logic: 
Are they effectively using loops, functions, and conditionals? Are there easier ways they could have accomplished certain things? 
Jquery Library: 
Student included the jQuery library and included code to affect the content and/or the behavior of their html pages using jQuery selectors and functionality. 
Flow Statements: 
Student used (correctly) basic control flow statements of Javascript (if/else, loops, switches) 
Data Understanding: 
Student demonstrated understanding of data types (including functions and objects) 
Logic Understanding: 
Student demonstrated understanding of logical operators (==, ===, !=, <, >, etc) 
Effective jQuery use-DOM: 
Student effectively used jQuery to traverse the DOM
Effective jQuery use-add/remove elements:  
Student effectively used jQuery to add/remove elements 
Effective jQuery use: 
Student’s jQuery code included a call to at least one function written in Javascript that returns an object that they then display elements from. 
Effective jQuery use-library: 
Student’s project included the jQuery UI library and at least one widget from the project (accordion, date picker, etc). 
Use of custom animation: 
Student’s project had at least one custom animation using $.animate ().	


@Fontface Typography: 
Sprites:  
Uploads successfully via FTP: 
Validates successfully:  
Correct use of HTML tags: 
Deprecated HTML tags - Avoids deprecated HTML tags (e.g. font>, center>,  u>, etc.) and opts for using more flexible alternatives with CSS  
Folder Structure: 
Develops and maintains appropriate folder structure: all site files and subfolders (images, css, js) should be contained in a semantically named parent folder. Furthermore, avoids using illegal characters (@, #,  spacebar, etc.) when naming files and directories 
Code Readability: 
Rate the readability of the student’s code. Is code well-indented and consistently spaced? Are complex pieces of logic appropriately commented? 
Code Maintainability: 
Is the code DRY (free from repetition of blocks of identical or highly similar code), do variables have intuitive names?
