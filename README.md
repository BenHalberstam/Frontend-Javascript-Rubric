## Functionality ##
1. Does the application function as intended?
2. The application is free from Javascript console errors.
3. The application is free from markup errors (missing/extra closing tags).
4. The application is free from CSS errors (non-existent properties, incorrect rule syntax).
5. The application is free from broken links.
6. The application is free from broken file references (images, css files, linked scripts).

##Appearance##
1. (1-3) How closely does the application’s front end match the designs (if applicable)?

##Performance##
(on a 1-3 scale, 3 being the best)
1. Rate the responsiveness of the application. Does it feel light and fast, or does it feel slow?
2. Rate how quickly the application loads.

##Structure/Organization##
1. Rate the student’s file structure. Are files separated into folders by file type and/or purpose? Are folder names and folder structure intuitive?
2. Rate the student’s separation of concerns. Are CSS rules and Javascript in separate files or are they lumped in with the HTML?
3. Rate the student’s use of SEO techniques to provide useful information to search engines. Does the student use <meta> tags? Do they put the appropriate text in header tags (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>)?
