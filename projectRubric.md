##Project Rubric

**Criteria**

In evaluating project submissions each criteria item is evaluated using the following levels: 

1. Subpar or Lacking Proficiency 
2. Baseline Proficiency
3. High Proficiency 


***Functionality***

| Metric | High Proficiency |Baseline Proficiency |Subpar or Lacking Proficiency |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Matching specifications |  The application functions exactly as intended. | The application functions mostly as intended. | The application does not function as intended.|
| Javascript Console Errors | No errors. | Less than 3 noted errors per page. | More than 3 noted errors per page. |
| Markup errors (missing/extra closing tags). | No errors. | Less than 3 noted errors per page. |  More than 3 noted errors. |
| CSS errors (non-existent properties, incorrect rule syntax). | No errors. | Less than [number] errors.|  More than [number] errors. |
| File references (images, css files, linked scripts). | No broken references. | Less than [number] broken references.| More than [number] broken references. |


***Appearance***

| Metric | High Proficiency |Baseline Proficiency |Subpar or Lacking Proficiency |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Matching specifications | The application’s front-end matches the designs exactly. |The application’s front-end matches the designs closely, but not exactly. | Less than 50% of the application’s front-end matches the design. | 
| Visual errors (unnecessary vertical/horizontal scroll distances,misplaced content) | No visual errors. | Less than 3 errors. | More than [number] errors. |

***Performance***

| Metric | High Proficiency |Baseline Proficiency |Subpar or Lacking Proficiency |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Responsiveness | The application feels light and fast. |The application is fast enough to keep a user from wanting to leave the page. | The application is slow and clunky. |
| Load Time | Using YSlow, the site is a grade A or better. | Using YSlow, the site is a B or better.| Using YSlow, the site is a C or below |

***Structure/Organization***

| Metric | High Proficiency |Baseline Proficiency |Subpar or Lacking Proficiency |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| File Structure | Files are separated into folders by file type and/or purpose. Folder names and folder structure is intuitive. | Files are separated into folders by file type and/or purpose. Folder names and folder structure might require some explanation to another developer. | Files are not all separated into folders by file type and/or purpose. Folder names and folder structure are not intuitive enough for sharing. |
| Separation of Concerns | CSS rules and Javascript are separated from HTML. | ? | CSS rules and Javascript are included in the HTML. | 
| SEO Techniques | SEO techniques (\<meta\> tags and header tags - \<h1\>, \<h2\>, \<h3\>) are used to effectively provide useful information to search engines throughout the code. | Some SEO techniques (\<meta\> tags and header tags - \<h1\>, \<h2\>,\<h3\>) are used to effectively provide useful information to search engines. | SEO techniques (\<meta\> tags and header tags - \<h1\>, \<h2\>, \<h3\>) are not effectively to provide useful information to search engines. |

***Code Quality: HTML***

| Metric | High Proficiency |Baseline Proficiency |Subpar or Lacking Proficiency |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
|Structure | The pages are broken down into logical sections. |	The pages are broken down into logical sections, with a few minor exceptions.| There may be some attempt at breaking the pages down into logical sections, but overall, they are not logically structured.|
|Choice of HTML tags|	The individual consistently chooses the best (most semantic) element for the job. Tags are nested correctly and logically.	| The individual chooses the best (most semantic) element for the job, with a few minor exceptions. 75%+ of tags are nested correctly and logically.|	The individual makes some unsuccessful attempts, but overall, fails to choose the best (most semantic) element for the job. Most tags are not nested correctly and logically.|
|Use of classes and IDs	|The individual appropriately uses classes on elements with similar purposes and/or similar styling. Class and ID names are intuitive, meaningful, and concise.|	The individual uses classes on some elements with similar purposes and/or similar styling. With some minor exceptions, class and ID names are intuitive, meaningful, and concise.|	The individual does not apply classes on elements with similar purposes and/or similar styling. Overall, class and ID names are not intuitive, meaningful, or concise.|
|Readability|	Code is very easy to read. |The individual indents consistently, and leaves frequent comments.|	Code is mostly easy to read. |The individual indents and leaves comments.	Because the individual does not indent consistently or leave comments, the code is challenging to read. |
|Separation of content|	The individual consistently makes good decisions about when to use CSS to achieve visual effects, over HTML.|	With a few minor exceptions, the individual uses CSS to achieve visual effects, over HTML, when appropriate.	|The individual uses HTML to achieve visual effects, when CSS would be more appropriate.|

**Code Quality CSS**

| Metric | High Proficiency |Baseline Proficiency |Subpar or Lacking Proficiency |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
|Structure|	The code is separated into logical sections.|	The code is broken down into logical sections, with a few minor exceptions.|	There may be some attempt at breaking the code down into logical sections, but overall, it is not logically structured.|
|Use of CSS Properties|	The individual demonstrates a command of a wide variety of properties and techniques. He/she successfully accomplishes the desired visual outcomes in standard, accepted ways.	|The individual demonstrates ability to implement a variety of properties and techniques. He/she accomplishes the desired visual outcomes, primarily through standard, accepted ways.|	The individual implements some properties and techniques. He/she may accomplish the desired visual outcomes, but misuses certain properties.|
|Readability|	Code is very easy to read. The individual indents consistently, and leaves frequent comments.|	Code is mostly easy to read. The individual indents and leaves comments.|	Because the individual does not indent consistently or leave comments, the code is challenging to read. |
|Concision |	The individual’s code is very concise. He/she makes clever use of selectors to keep the number of duplicate rules low.|	The individual’s code is concise, but there may be a few unnecessary duplicate rules.|	The code is not concise. There are several instances where selectors could have been used, but were not.|

**Code Quality Javascript**

| Metric | High Proficiency |Baseline Proficiency |Subpar or Lacking Proficiency |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
